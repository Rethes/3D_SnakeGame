## <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>

A classic snake game, developed using Python and pygame. This project introduces various advanced mechanics that enhance gameplay, including passing through walls, a self-collision-free snake, and challenging obstacles within the arena. With engaging visuals and a smooth interface, the game offers a dynamic and entertaining experience for players.

**Game Objects**
- snake: The player controls the snake and tries to grow it by eating apples.
- Apple: Increases the snakeâ€™s size and score when eaten.
- Banana: A power-up that appears after a certain number of apples are eaten. Gives a score boost and speed increase.
- Grape: Another power-up that appears after eating more apples. Gives a bigger score boost and speed increase.
**How to play the game**
The main objective is to control the snake, collect apples and other powerups, and achieve the highest possible score without colliding with obstacles or losing control.

**Basic Controls:**

**Arrow Keys:**
- Up: Move the snake up.
- Down: Move the snake down.
- Left: Move the snake left.
- Right: Move the snake right.

**Pause/Resume**
- Press P to pause or resume the game.
